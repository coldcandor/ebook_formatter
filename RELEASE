eBookFormatter Release Notes
----------------------------

Version 1.3.0

  - Initial Release - This version gives stable (read consistant) but sometimes 
    unfavorable results.  Check back frequently for updates.
  - While this version includes an RTF formatting removal tool, it is still very crude 
    and leaves very poorly formatted plain text.  Many improvements are planned for 
    furutre releases.
  - See README.txt and ChangeLog.txt for more information.
