Release Notes
-------------

See README.txt and ChangeLog.txt for more information.

Version 1.3.0

  - Initial Release - This version gives stable (read consistant) but sometimes 
    unfavorable results.  Check back frequently for updates.
  - While this version includes an RTF formatting removal tool, it is still very
    crude and leaves very poorly formatted plain text.  Many improvements are 
    planned for furutre releases.

Version 1.4.0

  - Problem found with the rtf formatter - the resulting file will contain no 
    newlines, preventing it from being successfully formatted by function 1.
  - Greatly updated command line interface - see README.txt "using 
    eBookFormatter" for details on how to use the new switch based method.
  - While this version supports stringing multiple functions into one run, the 
    result of the functions beyond the first will simply be added onto the 
    first, making it not very useful at present.
    
Version 1.5.5

  - RTF formatter and multiple-function-calling issues listed under Version 
    1.4.0 above have been fixed.  RTF formatter itself is still crude.
  - See "README.txt" for a description of the new function numbers, including
    the new testSuite function.
  - The testSuite function currently does nothing.
  
Version 1.6.0

  - Many changes and additions were made this version, but there are NO changes
    in the interface.
  - There are two additional files thies release:  testSuite.php and 
    testSuite.css.
