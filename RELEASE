eBookFormatter Release Notes
----------------------------

See README.txt and ChangeLog.txt for more information.

Version 1.3.0

  - Initial Release - This version gives stable (read consistant) but sometimes 
    unfavorable results.  Check back frequently for updates.
  - While this version includes an RTF formatting removal tool, it is still very crude 
    and leaves very poorly formatted plain text.  Many improvements are planned for 
    furutre releases.

Version 1.4.0

  - Problem found with the rtf formatter - the resulting file will contain no newlines, 
    preventing it from being successfully formatted by function 1.
  - Greatly updated command line interface - see README.txt "using eBookFormatter" for 
    details on how to use the new switch based method.
  - While this version supports stringing multiple functions into one run, the result
    of the functions beyond the first will simply be added onto the first, making it
    not very useful at present.
